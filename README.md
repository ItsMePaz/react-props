Exercise: Create a Link Component

In this exercise, we'll create a reusable Link component that can be used to navigate to a different page.

Create a new file called Link.js.

Define a functional component called Link that takes a text and url prop.

In the render method, return an a element with the text prop as its text content and the url prop as its href.

Export the Link component.

In your main component, define a url variable that contains a URL. Pass the text and url variables as props to the Link component.

Use the Link component to display a link that navigates to the URL when clicked.
